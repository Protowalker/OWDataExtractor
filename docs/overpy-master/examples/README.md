These gamemodes are all made by me (unless indicated otherwise). You can get a feel of how to make the most of overpy by looking at these gamemodes.

The gamemodes in the "old" folder are not modified to use the most recent version of overpy, however they can still serve as a good example of the power of overpy (macros, multiple files, json data, etc).
